The GAP 4 package 'NormalizInterface'
=====================================

1 Package description
=====================

Normaliz is a software for computations with rational cones and affine
monoids. It pursues two main computational goals: finding the Hilbert
basis, a minimal generating system of the monoid of lattice points of a
cone; and counting elements degree-wise in a generating function, the
Hilbert series.
As a recent extension, Normaliz can handle unbounded polyhedra. The
Hilbert basis computation can be considered as solving a linear
diophantine system of inhomogeneous equations, inequalities and
congruences.

This package encapsulates a libnormaliz cone and gives access to it in the
GAP enviroment. In this way GAP can be used as interactive interface to
libnormaliz.

For more information on Normaliz visit www.math.uos.de/normaliz and
especially have a look at the manual.


2 Installation preparation
==========================

You should use the same gmp version for GAP and libnormaliz. To ensure
this you can use a system installed gmp for GAP by configuring it with

    ./configure --with-gmp=system

and build it. Next you need Normaliz, the easiest way is to clone the master
branch from the Normaliz github repository with the command

    git clone https://github.com/csoeger/Normaliz Normaliz.git

into this directory. After that you can run the script "build-normaliz.sh".
Once it completed successfully, you can then build NormalizInterface
like this:

    ./autogen.sh (need autoconf and automake) (only for developers? TODO)
    ./configure --with-gaproot=GAPDIR --with-normaliz=$PWD/Normaliz.git/DST
    make

If you need to customize the normaliz compilation have a look at
Normaliz.git/source/INSTALL. Remember to use the same compiler and gmp
version as for GAP.
